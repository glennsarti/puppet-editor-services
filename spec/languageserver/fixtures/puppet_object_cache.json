Puppet produces an error if the\n`inline_epp` function fails to pass any required parameter.\n\nAn inline EPP template should be written as a single-quoted string or\n[heredoc](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_data_string.html#heredocs).\nA double-quoted string is subject to expression interpolation before the string\nis parsed as an EPP template.\n\nFor example, to evaluate an inline EPP template using a heredoc, call the\n`inline_epp` function like this:\n\n```puppet\n# Outputs 'Hello given argument planet!'\ninline_epp(@(END), { x => 'given argument' })\n<%- | $x, $y = planet | -%>\nHello <%= $x %> <%= $y %>!\nEND\n```","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"template","doc":"","types":["String"],"signature_key_offset":18,"signature_key_length":9},{"name":"parameters","doc":"","types":["Optional[Hash[Pattern[/^\\w+$/], Any]]"],"signature_key_offset":67,"signature_key_length":11}]}]},{"key":"join","calling_source":"/lib/puppet/functions/join.rb","source":"/lib/puppet/functions/join.rb","line":47,"char":34,"length":5,"doc":"Joins the values of an Array into a string with elements separated by a delimiter.\n\nSupports up to two arguments\n* **values** - first argument is required and must be an an `Array`\n* **delimiter** - second arguments is the delimiter between elements, must be a `String` if given, and defaults to an empty string.\n\n```puppet\njoin(['a','b','c'], \",\")\n# Would result in: \"a,b,c\"\n```\n\nNote that array is flattened before elements are joined, but flattening does not extend to arrays nested in hashes or other objects.\n\n```puppet\n$a = [1,2, undef, 'hello', [x,y,z], {a => 2, b => [3, 4]}]\nnotice join($a, ', ')\n\n# would result in noticing:\n# 1, 2, , hello, x, y, z, {\"a\"=>2, \"b\"=>[3, 4]}\n```\n\nFor joining iterators and other containers of elements a conversion must first be made to\nan `Array`.

By default,\nthis returns the first value found (and fails compilation if no values are\navailable), but you can configure it to merge multiple values into one, fail\ngracefully, and more.\n\nWhen looking up a key, Puppet will search up to three tiers of data, in the\nfollowing order:\n\n1. Hiera.\n2. The current environment's data provider.\n3. The indicated module's data provider, if the key is of the form\n   `<MODULE NAME>::<SOMETHING>`.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nYou must provide the name of a key to look up, and can optionally provide other\narguments. You can combine these arguments in the following ways:\n\n* `lookup( <NAME>, [<VALUE TYPE>], [<MERGE BEHAVIOR>], [<DEFAULT VALUE>] )`\n* `lookup( [<NAME>], <OPTIONS HASH> )`\n* `lookup( as above ) |$key| { # lambda returns a default value }`\n\nArguments in `[square brackets]` are optional.\n\nThe arguments accepted by `lookup` are as follows:\n\n1. `<NAME>` (string or array) --- The name of the key to look up.\n    * This can also be an array of keys. If Puppet doesn't find anything for the\n    first key, it will try again with the subsequent ones, only resorting to a\n    default value if none of them succeed.\n2. `<VALUE TYPE>` (data type) --- A\n[data type](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data_type.html)\nthat must match the retrieved value; if not, the lookup (and catalog\ncompilation) will fail. Defaults to `Data` (accepts any normal value).\n3. `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (string or hash; see **\"Merge Behaviors\"** below) ---\nWhether (and how) to combine multiple values. If present, this overrides any\nmerge behavior specified in the data sources. Defaults to no value; Puppet will\nuse merge behavior from the data sources if present, and will otherwise do a\nfirst-found lookup.\n4. `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (any normal value) --- If present, `lookup` returns this\nwhen it can't find a normal value. Default values are never merged with found\nvalues. Like a normal value, the default must match the value type. Defaults to\nno value; if Puppet can't find a normal value, the lookup (and compilation) will\nfail.\n5. `<OPTIONS HASH>` (hash) --- Alternate way to set the arguments above, plus\nsome less-common extra options. If you pass an options hash, you can't combine\nit with any regular arguments (except `<NAME>`). An options hash can have the\nfollowing keys:\n    * `'name'` --- Same as `<NAME>` (argument 1). You can pass this as an\n    argument or in the hash, but not both.\n    * `'value_type'` --- Same as `<VALUE TYPE>` (argument 2).\n    * `'merge'` --- Same as `<MERGE BEHAVIOR>` (argument 3).\n    * `'default_value'` --- Same as `<DEFAULT VALUE>` (argument 4).\n    * `'default_values_hash'` (hash) --- A hash of lookup keys and default\n    values. If Puppet can't find a normal value, it will check this hash for the\n    requested key before giving up. You can combine this with `default_value` or\n    a lambda, which will be used if the key isn't present in this hash. Defaults\n    to an empty hash.\n    * `'override'` (hash) --- A hash of lookup keys and override values. Puppet\n    will check for the requested key in the overrides hash _first;_ if found, it\n    returns that value as the _final_ value, ignoring merge behavior. Defaults\n    to an empty hash.\n\nFinally, `lookup` can take a lambda, which must accept a single parameter.\nThis is yet another way to set a default value for the lookup; if no results are\nfound, Puppet will pass the requested key to the lambda and use its result as\nthe default value.\n\n#### Merge Behaviors\n\nPuppet lookup uses a hierarchy of data sources, and a given key might have\nvalues in multiple sources. By default, Puppet returns the first value it finds,\nbut it can also continue searching and merge all the values together.\n\n> **Note:** Data sources can use the special `lookup_options` metadata key to\nrequest a specific merge behavior for a key. The `lookup` function will use that\nrequested behavior unless you explicitly specify one.\n\nThe valid merge behaviors are:\n\n* `'first'` --- Returns the first value found, with no merging. Puppet lookup's\ndefault behavior.\n* `'unique'` (called \"array merge\" in classic Hiera) --- Combines any number of\narrays and scalar values to return a merged, flattened array with all duplicate\nvalues removed. The lookup will fail if any hash values are found.\n* `'hash'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will use\nthe value from the highest-priority data source; it won't recursively merge the\nvalues.\n* `'deep'` --- Combines the keys and values of any number of hashes to return a\nmerged hash. If the same key exists in multiple source hashes, Puppet will\nrecursively merge hash or array values (with duplicate values removed from\narrays). For conflicting scalar values, the highest-priority value will win.\n* `{'strategy' => 'first'}`, `{'strategy' => 'unique'}`,\nor `{'strategy' => 'hash'}` --- Same as the string versions of these merge behaviors.\n* `{'strategy' => 'deep', <DEEP OPTION> => <VALUE>, ...}` --- Same as `'deep'`,\nbut can adjust the merge with additional options. The available options are:\n    * `'knockout_prefix'` (string or undef) --- A string prefix to indicate a\n    value should be _removed_ from the final result. If a value is exactly equal\n    to the prefix, it will knockout the entire element. Defaults to `undef`, which\n    disables this feature.\n    * `'sort_merged_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to sort all arrays that are\n    merged together. Defaults to `false`.\n    * `'merge_hash_arrays'` (boolean) --- Whether to merge hashes within arrays.\n    Defaults to `false`.","function_version":4,"signatures":[{"key":"lookup(NameType $name, Optional[ValueType] $value_type, Optional[MergeType] $merge)","doc":"","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"name","doc":"","types":["NameType"],"signature_key_offset":16,"signature_key_length":5},{"name":"value_type","doc":"","types":["Optional[ValueType]"],"signature_key_offset":43,"signature_key_length":11},{"name":"merge","doc":"","types":["Optional[MergeType]"],"signature_key_offset":76,"signature_key_length":6}]},{"key":"lookup(NameType $name, Optional[ValueType] $value_type, Optional[MergeType] $merge, DefaultValueType $default_value)","doc":"","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"name","doc":"","types":["NameType"],"signature_key_offset":16,"signature_key_length":5},{"name":"value_type","doc":"","types":["Optional[ValueType]"],"signature_key_offset":43,"signature_key_length":11},{"name":"merge","doc":"","types":["Optional[MergeType]"],"signature_key_offset":76,"signature_key_length":6},{"name":"default_value","doc":"","types":["DefaultValueType"],"signature_key_offset":101,"signature_key_length":14}]},{"key":"lookup(NameType $name, Optional[ValueType] $value_type, Optional[MergeType] $merge, BlockType &$block)","doc":"","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"name","doc":"","types":["NameType"],"signature_key_offset":16,"signature_key_length":5},{"name":"value_type","doc":"","types":["Optional[ValueType]"],"signature_key_offset":43,"signature_key_length":11},{"name":"merge","doc":"","types":["Optional[MergeType]"],"signature_key_offset":76,"signature_key_length":6},{"name":"&block","doc":"","types":["BlockType"],"signature_key_offset":94,"signature_key_length":7}]},{"key":"lookup(OptionsWithName $options_hash, Optional[BlockType] &$block)","doc":"Lookup without name.

When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow.

When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n**Signatures of String conversion**\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n**Integer to String**\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use see \"Creating a SemVer\"\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\n### Creating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```","function_version":4,"signatures":[{"key":"new(Type $type, Any *$args, Optional[Callable] &$block)","doc":"Creates a new instance/object of a given data type.\n\nThis function makes it possible to create new instances of\nconcrete data types. If a block is given it is called with the\njust created instance as an argument.\n\nCalling this function is equivalent to directly\ncalling the data type:\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\")\n$b = Integer(\"42\")\n```\n\nThese would both convert the string `\"42\"` to the decimal value `42`.\n\n```puppet\n$a = Integer.new(\"42\", 8)\n$b = Integer({from => \"42\", radix => 8})\n```\n\nThis would convert the octal (radix 8) number `\"42\"` in string form\nto the decimal value `34`.\n\nThe new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:\n\n* by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)\n* by position (as regular arguments)\n\nNote that it is not possible to create new instances of\nsome abstract data types (for example `Variant`). The data type `Optional[T]` is an\nexception as it will create an instance of `T` or `undef` if the\nvalue to convert is `undef`.\n\nThe arguments that can be given is determined by the data type.\n\n> An assertion is always made that the produced value complies with the given type constraints.\n\n```puppet\nInteger[0].new(\"-100\")\n```\n\nWould fail with an assertion error (since value is less than 0).\n\nThe following sections show the arguments and conversion rules\nper data type built into the Puppet Type System.\n\n### Conversion to Optional[T] and NotUndef[T]\n\nConversion to these data types is the same as a conversion to the type argument `T`.\nIn the case of `Optional[T]` it is accepted that the argument to convert may be `undef`.\nIt is however not acceptable to give other arguments (than `undef`) that cannot be\nconverted to `T`.\n\n### Conversion to Integer\n\nA new `Integer` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` it is possible to specify the radix (base).\n\n```puppet\ntype Radix = Variant[Default, Integer[2,2], Integer[8,8], Integer[10,10], Integer[16,16]]\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  String $value,\n  Radix $radix = 10,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n\nfunction Integer.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = false\n)\n```\n\n* When converting from `String` the default radix is 10.\n* If radix is not specified an attempt is made to detect the radix from the start of the string:\n  * `0b` or `0B` is taken as radix 2.\n  * `0x` or `0X` is taken as radix 16.\n  * `0` as radix 8.\n  * All others are decimal.\n* Conversion from `String` accepts an optional sign in the string.\n* For hexadecimal (radix 16) conversion an optional leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" is accepted.\n* For octal (radix 8) an optional leading \"0\" is accepted.\n* For binary (radix 2) an optional leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" is accepted.\n* When `radix` is set to `default`, the conversion is based on the leading.\n  characters in the string. A leading \"0\" for radix 8, a leading \"0x\", or \"0X\" for\n  radix 16, and leading \"0b\" or \"0B\" for binary.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* Conversion from `Integer`, `Float`, and `Boolean` ignores the radix.\n* `Float` value fractions are truncated (no rounding).\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute integer.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Integer(\"0xFF\", 16)    # results in 255\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\")         # results in 8\n$a_number = Integer(\"010\", 10)     # results in 10\n$a_number = Integer(true)          # results in 1\n$a_number = Integer(-38, 10, true) # results in 38\n```\n\n### Conversion to Float\n\nA new `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.\nFor conversion from `String` both float and integer formats are supported.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Float.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* For an integer, the floating point fraction of `.0` is added to the value.\n* A `Boolean` `true` is converted to 1.0, and a `false` to 0.0\n* In `String` format, integer prefixes for hex and binary are understood (but not octal since\n  floating point in string format may start with a '0').\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute floating point value.\n\n### Conversion to Numeric\n\nA new `Integer` or `Float` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean` and\n`String` values.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Numeric.new(\n  Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String] $value,\n  Boolean $abs = true\n)\n```\n\n* If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation\n  (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The\n  conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.\n* Conversion from `Boolean` results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.\n* When `abs` is set to `true`, the result will be an absolute `Float`or `Integer` value.\n\n```puppet\n$a_number = Numeric(true)        # results in 1\n$a_number = Numeric(\"0xFF\")      # results in 255\n$a_number = Numeric(\"010\")       # results in 8\n$a_number = Numeric(\"3.14\")      # results in 3.14 (a float)\n$a_number = Numeric(-42.3, true) # results in 42.3\n$a_number = Numeric(-42, true)   # results in 42\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timespan\n\nA new `Timespan` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timespan from seconds**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from days, hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second**\n\nThe arguments can be passed separately in which case the first four, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are mandatory and the rest are optional.\nAll values may overflow and/or be negative. The internal 128-bit nano-second integer is calculated as:\n\n```\n(((((days * 24 + hours) * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds) * 1000 + milliseconds) * 1000 + microseconds) * 1000 + nanoseconds\n```\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Integer $days, Integer $hours, Integer $minutes, Integer $seconds,\n  Integer $milliseconds = 0, Integer $microseconds = 0, Integer $nanoseconds = 0\n)\n```\n\nor, all arguments can be passed as a `Hash`, in which case all entries are optional:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    Optional[negative] => Boolean,\n    Optional[days] => Integer,\n    Optional[hours] => Integer,\n    Optional[minutes] => Integer,\n    Optional[seconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[milliseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[microseconds] => Integer,\n    Optional[nanoseconds] => Integer\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\n**Timespan from String and format directive patterns**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  String $string, Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timespan.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n\n##### Format directives:\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| D | Number of Days |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..59) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999) |\n| N | Fractional seconds digits |\n\nThe format directive that represents the highest magnitude in the format will be allowed to\noverflow. I.e. if no \"%D\" is used but a \"%H\" is present, then the hours may be more than 23.\n\nThe default array contains the following patterns:\n\n```\n['%D-%H:%M:%S', '%D-%H:%M', '%H:%M:%S', '%H:%M']\n```\n\nExamples - Converting to Timespan\n\n```puppet\n$duration = Timespan(13.5)       # 13 seconds and 500 milliseconds\n$duration = Timespan({days=>4})  # 4 days\n$duration = Timespan(4, 0, 0, 2) # 4 days and 2 seconds\n$duration = Timespan('13:20')    # 13 hours and 20 minutes (using default pattern)\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%L') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 milli-seconds\n$duration = Timespan('10:03.5', '%M:%S.%N') # 10 minutes, 3 seconds, and 5 nano-seconds\n```\n\n### Conversion to Timestamp\n\nA new `Timestamp` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, and `Hash` values. Several variants of the constructor are provided.\n\n**Timestamp from seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)**\n\nWhen a Float is used, the decimal part represents fractions of a second.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Variant[Float, Integer] $value\n)\n```\n\n**Timestamp from String and patterns consisting of format directives**\n\nThe first argument is parsed using the format optionally passed as a string or array of strings. When an array is used, an attempt\nwill be made to parse the string using the first entry and then with each entry in succession until parsing succeeds. If the second\nargument is omitted, an array of default formats will be used.\n\nA third optional timezone argument can be provided. The first argument will then be parsed as if it represents a local time in that\ntimezone. The timezone can be any timezone that is recognized when using the '%z' or '%Z' formats, or the word 'current', in which\ncase the current timezone of the evaluating process will be used. The timezone argument is case insensitive.\n\nThe default timezone, when no argument is provided, or when using the keyword `default`, is 'UTC'.\n\nIt is illegal to provide a timezone argument other than `default` in combination with a format that contains '%z' or '%Z' since that\nwould introduce an ambiguity as to which timezone to use. The one extracted from the string, or the one provided as an argument.\n\nAn exception is raised when no format was able to parse the given string.\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  String $string,\n  Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]] $format = <default format>,\n  String $timezone = default)\n)\n```\n\nthe arguments may also be passed as a `Hash`:\n\n```puppet\nfunction Timestamp.new(\n  Struct[{\n    string => String[1],\n    Optional[format] => Variant[String[2],Array[String[2], 1]],\n    Optional[timezone] => String[1]\n  }] $hash\n)\n```\n\nThe directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags, optional minimum field width and\na conversion specifier as follows:\n```\n%[Flags][Width]Conversion\n```\n\n##### Flags:\n\n| Flag  | Meaning\n| ----  | ---------------\n| -     | Don't pad numerical output\n| _     | Use spaces for padding\n| 0     | Use zeros for padding\n| #     | Change names to upper-case or change case of am/pm\n| ^     | Use uppercase\n| :     | Use colons for %z\n\n##### Format directives (names and padding can be altered using flags):\n\n**Date (Year, Month, Day):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| Y | Year with century, zero-padded to at least 4 digits |\n| C | year / 100 (rounded down such as 20 in 2009) |\n| y | year % 100 (00..99) |\n| m | Month of the year, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| B | The full month name (\"January\") |\n| b | The abbreviated month name (\"Jan\") |\n| h | Equivalent to %b |\n| d | Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31) |\n| e | Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31) |\n| j | Day of the year (001..366) |\n\n**Time (Hour, Minute, Second, Subsecond):**\n\n| Format | Meaning |\n| ------ | ------- |\n| H | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, zero-padded (00..23) |\n| k | Hour of the day, 24-hour clock, blank-padded ( 0..23) |\n| I | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, zero-padded (01..12) |\n| l | Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded ( 1..12) |\n| P | Meridian indicator, lowercase (\"am\" or \"pm\") |\n| p | Meridian indicator, uppercase (\"AM\" or \"PM\") |\n| M | Minute of the hour (00..59) |\n| S | Second of the minute (00..60) |\n| L | Millisecond of the second (000..999).

The defaults for the many options\nhave been chosen with care to be the most basic \"value in textual form\" representation.\nThe more advanced forms of formatting are intended to enable writing special purposes formatting\nfunctions in the Puppet language.\n\nA new string can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in\nseveral steps - first the data type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting data type\nis used to find the most significant format specified for that data type. And finally,\nthe found format is used to convert the given value.\n\nThe mapping from data type to format is referred to as the *format map*. This map\nallows different formatting depending on type.\n\n```puppet\n$format_map = {\n  Integer[default, 0] => \"%d\",\n  Integer[1, default] => \"%#x\"\n}\nString(\"-1\", $format_map)  # produces '-1'\nString(\"10\", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'\n```\n\nA format is specified on the form:\n\n```\n%[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format\n```\n\n`Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is\npadded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag `0` will cause padding with `0`\nfor numerical formats.\n\n`Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters\nincluded in a string format.\n\nNote that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning \"default string representation\" and\n\"default programmatic string representation\" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).\n\n**Signatures of String conversion**\n\n```puppet\ntype Format = Pattern[/^%([\\s\\+\\-#0\\[\\{<\\(\\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]\ntype ContainerFormat = Struct[{\n  format         => Optional[String],\n  separator      => Optional[String],\n  separator2     => Optional[String],\n  string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]\n  }]\ntype TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]\ntype Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]\n\nfunction String.new(\n  Any $value,\n  Formats $string_formats\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at\n  the end), defaults to `\",\"`\n* `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as\n  wanted), defaults to `\" => \"`.\n* `string_formats` is a data type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => \"%p\"}`. Note that\n  these nested formats are not applicable to data types that are containers; they are always formatted as per the top level\n  format specification.\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10)      # produces '10'\n$str = String([10])    # produces '[\"10\"]'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$str = String(10, \"%#x\")    # produces '0x10'\n$str = String([10], \"%(a\")  # produces '(\"10\")'\n```\n\n```puppet\n$formats = {\n  Array => {\n    format => '%(a',\n    string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' }\n  }\n}\n$str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'\n```\n\nThe given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on\nthe specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.\n\n**Integer to String**\n\n| Format  | Integer Formats\n| ------  | ---------------\n| d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'.\n| x X     | Hexadecimal in lower or upper case.

an array of tuples on the form `[path, value]`\n(where the `path` is the path from the root of a tree, and `value` the value at that position in the tree), and\neither the option `'tree'` (do not convert arrays to hashes except the top level), or\n`'hash_tree'` (convert all arrays to hashes).\n\nThe tree/hash_tree forms of Hash creation are suited for transforming the result of an iteration\nusing `tree_each` and subsequent filtering or mapping.\n\nMapping an arbitrary structure in a way that keeps the structure, but where some values are replaced\ncan be done by using the `tree_each` function, mapping, and then constructing a new Hash from the result:\n\n```puppet\n# A hash tree with 'water' at different locations\n$h = { a => { b => { x => 'water'}}, b => { y => 'water'} }\n# a helper function that turns water into wine\nfunction make_wine($x) { if $x == 'water' { 'wine' } else { $x } }\n# create a flattened tree with water turned into wine\n$flat_tree = $h.tree_each.map |$entry| { [$entry[0], make_wine($entry[1])] }\n# create a new Hash and log it\nnotice Hash($flat_tree, 'hash_tree')\n```\n\nWould notice the hash `{a => {b => {x => wine}}, b => {y => wine}}`\n\nConversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is\nasserted against the given struct type.\n\n### Conversion to a Regexp\n\nA `String` can be converted into a `Regexp`\n\n**Example**: Converting a String into a Regexp\n```puppet\n$s = '[a-z]+\\.com'\n$r = Regexp($s)\nif('foo.com' =~ $r) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVer\n\nA SemVer object represents a single [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).\nIt can be created from a String, individual values for its parts, or a hash specifying the value per part.\nSee the specification at [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for the meaning of the SemVer's parts.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype PositiveInteger = Integer[0,default]\ntype SemVerQualifier = Pattern[/\\A(?<part>[0-9A-Za-z-]+)(?:\\.\\g<part>)*\\Z/]\ntype SemVerString = String[1]\ntype SemVerHash =Struct[{\n  major                => PositiveInteger,\n  minor                => PositiveInteger,\n  patch                => PositiveInteger,\n  Optional[prerelease] => SemVerQualifier,\n  Optional[build]      => SemVerQualifier\n}]\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerString $str)\n\nfunction SemVer.new(\n        PositiveInteger           $major\n        PositiveInteger           $minor\n        PositiveInteger           $patch\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $prerelease = undef\n        Optional[SemVerQualifier] $build = undef\n        )\n\nfunction SemVer.new(SemVerHash $hash_args)\n```\n\n```puppet\n# As a type, SemVer can describe disjunct ranges which versions can be\n# matched against - here the type is constructed with two\n# SemVerRange objects.\n#\n$t = SemVer[\n  SemVerRange('>=1.0.0 <2.0.0'),\n  SemVerRange('>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')\n]\nnotice(SemVer('1.2.3') =~ $t) # true\nnotice(SemVer('2.3.4') =~ $t) # false\nnotice(SemVer('3.4.5') =~ $t) # true\n```\n\n### Creating a SemVerRange\n\nA `SemVerRange` object represents a range of `SemVer`. It can be created from\na `String`, or from two `SemVer` instances, where either end can be given as\na literal `default` to indicate infinity. The string format of a `SemVerRange` is specified by\nthe [Semantic Version Range Grammar](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).\n\n> Use of the comparator sets described in the grammar (joining with `||`) is not supported.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype SemVerRangeString = String[1]\ntype SemVerRangeHash = Struct[{\n  min                   => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[max]         => Variant[Default, SemVer],\n  Optional[exclude_max] => Boolean\n}]\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeString $semver_range_string\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $min\n  Variant[Default,SemVer] $max\n  Optional[Boolean]       $exclude_max = undef\n)\n\nfunction SemVerRange.new(\n  SemVerRangeHash $semver_range_hash\n)\n```\n\nFor examples of `SemVerRange` use see \"Creating a SemVer\"\n\n### Creating a Binary\n\nA `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format,\nan Array containing byte values. A Binary can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to\na `Binary`.\n\nThe signatures are:\n\n```puppet\ntype ByteInteger = Integer[0,255]\ntype Base64Format = Enum[\"%b\", \"%u\", \"%B\", \"%s\"]\ntype StringHash = Struct[{value => String, \"format\" => Optional[Base64Format]}]\ntype ArrayHash = Struct[{value => Array[ByteInteger]}]\ntype BinaryArgsHash = Variant[StringHash, ArrayHash]\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  String $base64_str,\n  Optional[Base64Format] $format\n)\n\n\nfunction Binary.new(\n  Array[ByteInteger] $byte_array\n}\n\n# Same as for String, or for Array, but where arguments are given in a Hash.\nfunction Binary.new(BinaryArgsHash $hash_args)\n```\n\nThe formats have the following meaning:\n\n| format | explanation |\n| ----   | ----        |\n| B | The data is in base64 strict encoding\n| u | The data is in URL safe base64 encoding\n| b | The data is in base64 encoding, padding as required by base64 strict, is added by default\n| s | The data is a puppet string. The string must be valid UTF-8, or convertible to UTF-8 or an error is raised.\n| r | (Ruby Raw) the byte sequence in the given string is used verbatim irrespective of possible encoding errors\n\n* The default format is `%B`.\n* Note that the format `%r` should be used sparingly, or not at all. It exists for backwards compatibility reasons when someone receiving\n  a string from some function and that string should be treated as Binary. Such code should be changed to return a Binary instead of a String.\n\n```puppet\n# create the binary content \"abc\"\n$a = Binary('YWJj')\n\n# create the binary content from content in a module's file\n$b = binary_file('mymodule/mypicture.jpg')\n```\n\n* Since 4.5.0\n* Binary type since 4.8.0\n\n### Creating an instance of a `Type` using the `Init` type\n\nThe type `Init[T]` describes a value that can be used when instantiating a type. When used as the first argument in a call to `new`, it\nwill dispatch the call to its contained type and optionally augment the parameter list with additional arguments.\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer].new('128')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer.new('128')\n```\n\nor, with base 16 and using implicit new\n\n```puppet\n# The following declaration\n$x = Init[Integer,16]('80')\n# is exactly the same as\n$x = Integer('80', 16)\n```\n\n```puppet\n$fmt = Init[String,'%#x']\nnotice($fmt(256)) # will notice '0x100'\n```","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"type","doc":"","types":["Type"],"signature_key_offset":9,"signature_key_length":5},{"name":"*args","doc":"","types":["Any"],"signature_key_offset":20,"signature_key_length":6},{"name":"&block","doc":"","types":["Optional[Callable]"],"signature_key_offset":47,"signature_key_length":7}]}]},{"key":"next","calling_source":"/lib/puppet/functions/next.rb","source":"/lib/puppet/functions/next.rb","line":6,"char":34,"length":5,"doc":"Since 4.7.0\n\nMakes iteration continue with the next value, optionally with a given value for this iteration.\nIf a value is not given it defaults to `undef`","function_version":4,"signatures":[{"key":"next(Optional[Any] $value)","doc":"Makes iteration continue with the next value, optionally with a given value for this iteration.\nIf a value is not given it defaults to `undef`","return_types":["Any"],"parameters":[{"name":"value","doc":"","types":["Optional[Any]"],"signature_key_offset":19,"signature_key_length":6}]}]},{"key":"notice","calling_source":"/lib/puppet/functions/notice.rb","source":"/lib/puppet/functions/notice.rb","line":2,"char":34,"length":7,"doc":"Logs a message on the server at level `notice`.","function_version":4,"signatures":[{"key":"notice(Any *$values)","doc":"Logs a message on the server at level `notice`.","return_types":["Undef"],"parameters":[{"name":"*values","doc":"The values to log.","types":["Any"],"signature_key_offset":11,"signature_key_length":8}]}]},{"key":"partition","calling_source":"/lib/puppet/functions/partition.rb","source":"/lib/puppet/functions/partition.rb","line":5,"char":34,"length":10,"doc":"Returns two arrays, the first containing the elements of enum for which the block evaluates to true,\nthe second containing the rest.","function_version":4,"signatures":[{"key":"partition(Collection $collection, Callable[1,1] &$block)","doc":"","return_types":["Tuple[Array, Array]"],"parameters":[{"name":"collection","doc":"A collection of things to partition.","types":["Collection"],"signature_key_offset":21,"signature_key_length":11},{"name":"&block","doc":"","types":["Callable[1,1]"],"signature_key_offset":48,"signature_key_length":7}]},{"key":"partition(Array $array, Callable[2,2] &$block)","doc":"","return_types":["Tuple[Array, Array]"],"parameters":[{"name":"array","doc":"","types":["Array"],"signature_key_offset":16,"signature_key_length":6},{"name":"&block","doc":"","types":["Callable[2,2]"],"signature_key_offset":38,"signature_key_length":7}]},{"key":"partition(Collection $collection, Callable[2,2] &$block)","doc":"","return_types":["Tuple[Array, Array]"],"parameters":[{"name":"collection","doc":"","types":["Collection"],"signature_key_offset":21,"signature_key_length":11},{"name":"&block","doc":"","types":["Callable[2,2]"],"signature_key_offset":48,"signature_key_length":7}]}]},{"key":"reduce","calling_source":"/lib/puppet/functions/reduce.rb","source":"/lib/puppet/functions/reduce.rb","line":130,"char":34,"length":7,"doc":"Since 4.0.0\n\nApplies a [lambda](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_lambdas.html)\nto every value in a data structure from the first argument, carrying over the returned\nvalue of each iteration, and returns the result of the lambda's final iteration.

An array, hash, or other iterable object that the function will iterate over.\n2. A lambda, which the function calls for each element in the first argument. It takes\ntwo mandatory parameters:\n    1. A memo value that is overwritten after each iteration with the iteration's result.\n    2.

When the first\nargument is a hash, Puppet converts each of the hash's values to an array in the form\n`[key, value]`.\n\nIf you pass a start memo value, Puppet executes the lambda with the provided memo value\nand the data structure's first value. Otherwise, Puppet passes the structure's first two\nvalues to the lambda.\n\nPuppet calls the lambda for each of the data structure's remaining values. For each\ncall, it passes the result of the previous call as the first parameter ($memo in the\nabove examples) and the next value from the data structure as the second parameter\n($value).\n\nIf the structure has one value, Puppet returns the value and does not call the lambda.\n\n```puppet\n# Reduce the array $data, returning the sum of all values in the array.\n$data = [1, 2, 3]\n$sum = $data.reduce |$memo, $value| { $memo + $value }\n# $sum contains 6\n\n# Reduce the array $data, returning the sum of a start memo value and all values in the\n# array.\n$data = [1, 2, 3]\n$sum = $data.reduce(4) |$memo, $value| { $memo + $value }\n# $sum contains 10\n\n# Reduce the hash $data, returning the sum of all values and concatenated string of all\n# keys.\n$data = {a => 1, b => 2, c => 3}\n$combine = $data.reduce |$memo, $value| {\n  $string = \"${memo[0]}${value[0]}\"\n  $number = $memo[1] + $value[1]\n  [$string, $number]\n}\n# $combine contains [abc, 6]\n```\n\n```puppet\n# Reduce the array $data, returning the sum of all values in the array and starting\n# with $memo set to an arbitrary value instead of $data's first value.\n$data = [1, 2, 3]\n$sum = $data.reduce(4) |$memo, $value| { $memo + $value }\n# At the start of the lambda's first iteration, $memo contains 4 and $value contains 1.\n# After all iterations, $sum contains 10.\n\n# Reduce the hash $data, returning the sum of all values and concatenated string of\n# all keys, and starting with $memo set to an arbitrary array instead of $data's first\n# key-value pair.\n$data = {a => 1, b => 2, c => 3}\n$combine = $data.reduce( [d, 4] ) |$memo, $value| {\n  $string = \"${memo[0]}${value[0]}\"\n  $number = $memo[1] + $value[1]\n  [$string, $number]\n}\n# At the start of the lambda's first iteration, $memo contains [d, 4] and $value\n# contains [a, 1].\n# $combine contains [dabc, 10]\n```\n\n```puppet\n# Reduce a hash of hashes $data, merging defaults into the inner hashes.\n$data = {\n  'connection1' => {\n    'username' => 'user1',\n    'password' => 'pass1',\n  },\n  'connection_name2' => {\n    'username' => 'user2',\n    'password' => 'pass2',\n  },\n}\n\n$defaults = {\n  'maxActive' => '20',\n  'maxWait'   => '10000',\n  'username'  => 'defaultuser',\n  'password'  => 'defaultpass',\n}\n\n$merged = $data.reduce( {} ) |$memo, $x| {\n  $memo + { $x[0] => $defaults + $data[$x[0]] }\n}\n# At the start of the lambda's first iteration, $memo is set to {}, and $x is set to\n# the first [key, value] tuple.

There are three\nmain ways for an exec to be idempotent:\n\n* The command itself is already idempotent. (For example, `apt-get update`.)\n* The exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute, which prevents\n  Puppet from running the command unless some condition is met.\n* The exec has `refreshonly => true`, which allows Puppet to run the\n  command only when some other resource is changed. (See the notes on refreshing\n  below.)\n\nThe state managed by an `exec` resource represents whether the specified command\n_needs to be_ executed during the catalog run. The target state is always that\nthe command does not need to be executed. If the initial state is that the\ncommand _does_ need to be executed, then successfully executing the command\ntransitions it to the target state.\n\nThe `unless`, `onlyif`, and `creates` properties check the initial state of the\nresource. If one or more of these properties is specified, the exec might not\nneed to run. If the exec does not need to run, then the system is already in\nthe target state. In such cases, the exec is considered successful without\nactually executing its command.\n\nA caution: There's a widespread tendency to use collections of execs to\nmanage resources that aren't covered by an existing resource type. This\nworks fine for simple tasks, but once your exec pile gets complex enough\nthat you really have to think to understand what's happening, you should\nconsider developing a custom resource type instead, as it is much\nmore predictable and maintainable.\n\n**Duplication:** Even though `command` is the namevar, Puppet allows\nmultiple `exec` resources with the same `command` value.\n\n**Refresh:** `exec` resources can respond to refresh events (via\n`notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). The refresh behavior of execs\nis non-standard, and can be affected by the `refresh` and\n`refreshonly` attributes:\n\n* If `refreshonly` is set to true, the exec runs _only_ when it receives an\n  event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.\n* If the exec has already run and then receives an event, it runs its\n  command **up to two times.** If an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` condition\n  is no longer met after the first run, the second run does not occur.\n* If the exec has already run, has a `refresh` command, and receives an\n  event, it runs its normal command. Then, if any `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates`\n  conditions are still met, the exec runs its `refresh` command.\n* If the exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute that prevents it\n  from running, and it then receives an event, it still will not run.\n* If the exec has `noop => true`, would otherwise have run, and receives\n  an event from a non-noop resource, it runs once. However, if it has a `refresh`\n  command, it runs that instead of its normal command.\n\nIn short: If there's a possibility of your exec receiving refresh events,\nit is extremely important to make sure the run conditions are restricted.\n\n**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable\nfile used in an exec's command, the exec resource autorequires those\nfiles.

The Win32 APIs define exit codes as 32-bit unsigned integers, but\nboth the cmd.exe shell and the .NET runtime cast them to signed\nintegers. This means some tools will report negative numbers for exit\ncodes above 2147483647. (For example, cmd.exe reports 4294967295 as -1.)\nSince Puppet uses the plain Win32 APIs, it will report the very large\nnumber instead of the negative number, which might not be what you\nexpect if you got the exit code from a cmd.exe session.\n\nMicrosoft recommends against using negative/very large exit codes, and\nyou should avoid them when possible.
